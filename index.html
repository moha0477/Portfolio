      <img src="assets/images/portfolio.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Portfolio Photo">

      <p>My name is Salma Mohamed, and I am currently a Full Stack Engineering student with the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. As of now, I am a Front-End Developer that is proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and APIs. </p>

      <p>I am a 2019 University of Minnesota Alumna with a major in Physiology and minors in Public Health and Arabic. During my college years, I was passionate about pursusing a career in medicine as a physician, and therefore got certified as an EMT in order to gain valuable experience in the field. However, shadowing and observing the physicians, physician assistants, and healthcare administrators in my clinic made me realize that this was not the right career for me.</p>
      
      <p>I opened myself up to other career options and ended up gravitating towards the world of software development. I attended an "Intro to Web Development" workshop, which entranced me to do further research and eventually apply to my program. I am very satisfied with my decision and thorougly enjoy gaining these new skills.</p>
